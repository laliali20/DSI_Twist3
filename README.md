### About the project 

The goal of the competition was to detect sentiments in coverage of two major political players in United States politics over the last one month.

The data is sourced from GDETL which contained a huge and complex dataset. It uses a lot of reference codes and inconsistent formatting. By itself, this posed a major processing and querying challenge.
